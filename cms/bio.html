            Jeffrey Appiatu, born in Ghana, is a self taught pencil artist who specializes in hyperrealism.

            Imagine living in a world with no mirrors or reflective surfaces... As a kid, Jeffery always wondered how the world would turn out to be if there were no mirrors. This fueled his strong passion for drawing because he wanted subjects and viewers to feel like they are looking at a reflection in a mirror which makes them process every emotion in a drawing. Every detail matters in capturing the emotion of subjects. Drawing has made Jeffery connect more with people as an individual taking into consideration movements and important cues. He feels every emotion and expression that comes with drawing a subject.
            
            By making Hyperrealistic art, He has come to the realization that art expressions have no limit and that is a clear demonstration of how much power humans have. Every drawing has a story to tell and this makes viewers happy because a humble pencil can produce realistic results.
            
            There are more stories to be told in the world and Art is the greatest medium to tell these stories.
            
            Using charcoal and graphite on paper, Jeffrey's attention to detail captures every bit of emotion his subjects are showing which strike a connection to the viewer. He gets his inspiration from music, everyday situations in society and personal life experiences. From the sad expression to neutral to happy, the charcoal drawings by Jeffrey always catches the viewers attention to question if it is indeed a drawing or a photograph.</textarea
